Purpose of this Project: 

1.	UI presentation using ReactJs
2.	Backend API using Asp.net Core C# (Latest 3.1 at the time of this project).
3.	Consumption of a 3rd party API from Backend API (not from UI)

The ABC provides a ROI calculator tool to conduct this check online where 10 investment options are available as follows 
 
{
  "investmentOptions": [
    "Cash investments",
    "Fixed interest" ,
    "Shares",
    "Managed funds",
    "Exchange traded funds (ETFs)",
    "Investment bonds",
    "Annuities",
    "Listed investment companies (LICs)",
    "Real estate investment trusts (REITs)"
  ]
}

The UI is independent of this backend project (link available on request). The UI is currently developed using React JS.

Once the user selects the type of investments from UI and the total amount, the web API project will return a value in USD on the total ROI & Fee to the UI/User.
